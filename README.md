# Yahtzee!
Made in java! This is my first program I have made with a graphical interface, so it is probably pretty poorly coded and can be largely optimized.
### To Do
- Add dice rolling "animation"
- Add warnings when trying to scratch a number
### Completed
- Added core dice functionality
- Added scorecard calculations for every combonation
- Added some information that popps up for yahtzee bonuses
- Add more information on how to play
- Create executable .jar file for the first release

# How to Install & Run
- Download JAR file from releases tab
- Make sure you have [JDK 17](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk17-archive-downloads.html) or later installed.
- Double click to run the jar file. If it has errors or never opens, try the
next step.
- Open terminal in file location and run ```java -jar Yahtzee.jar``` on windows 
or ```java -jar Yahtzee-MacOS.jar``` for MacOS.
- If it still does not run, open an [issue](https://github.com/hlqGit/Yahtzee-in-Java/issues) and I will look into it
