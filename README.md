# Yahtzee!
Made in java! This is my first program I have made with a graphical interface, so it is probably pretty poorly coded and can be largely optimized.
## Project is not completed!
Right now I only have the core dice functionality, being able to roll and hold any dice. I have plans to add more features in the next few days, and once it is complete I will publish the first release of the program.
## To Do
- Add scorecard functionality
- Create score calculations for different combonations of dice
- Add in player turns
- Limit player to 3 rolls per turn
- Add restarting functionality
