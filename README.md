# Yahtzee!
Made in java! This is my first program I have made with a graphical interface, so it is probably pretty poorly coded and can be largely optimized.
## To Do
- Add dice rolling "animation"
- Add more information on how to play
- fix being able to scratch any number
- Create executable .jar file for the first release
- Provide compatibility for MacOS
## Completed
- Added core dice functionality
- Added scorecard calculations for every combonation
- Added some information that popps up for yahtzee bonuses
